If you speed up something that takes 50% of the runtime by a factor of 100, you speed up the code by a factor of 2. Even if a piece of code takes 10% of the runtime, a factor of 2 improvement (which by itself is often hard to get) only gives you a 5% improvement in the end. **Focus your effort on optimizing the runtime of the one or two functions that take the most amount of time.**\n",

If a piece of code takes only 0.0001% of the runtime, any amount of speed up is not worth making the code hard to read (from a person-hour perspective). Many times, it is difficult to gain more than a factor of 2 speed up in runtime. Definitely think about the potential gain in speed-up versus how long it takes to write and maintian the code.\n",

    "Generally algorithm runtimes scale as N^a where a is some positive number greater than 1, and N is the size of your data. (In CS terms, this is often disccused in \"Big O\" notation as  $O(N^a)$ runtime). If your data is too big or takes too long to benchmark on a single machine, try running your code on much smaller data. If you do this for ~3-5 different test data with different N, you can estimate what is the scaling of your code (i.e., what is \"a\"). Once you know the scaling you can use that scaling relation to extrapolate how long it will take on larger datasets. If you can also use more cores, you can divide the final runtime by the number of cores you can use. \n",

    "For example, my code takes 1 second on 10x10 data, 100 seconds on 100x100 data, and 400 seconds on 200x200 data (all on a single core). My code scales as N^2 where N is the size of one dimension of the data. If I want to run it on 10000x10000 data with 100 cores, my code should take (10000^2)/100 = 1,000,000 seconds to run.\n",

    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are worried that your program will run out of memory, try calculating how much memory your program uses. On modern 64-bit machines, a single number (an integer, float) takes up 8 bytes. If you have an array of 1000x1000 floats, then it will take up 8e6 bytes or 8 MBs. If you have 3-D numerical data with dimensions 1000x1000x1000, then it will take up 8e9 bytes or 8 GBs."
