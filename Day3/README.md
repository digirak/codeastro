## Project Goals

  * Turn your project into a python package using `setup.py` and `__init__.py`
  * Deploy a version (even preliminary) to PyPI with a LICENSE and version number
  * Start a readthedocs page for your repo
  * Aim to finish the basic functionality of your package

## Learning Objectives

  * Be able to use docstrings and sphinx to document code for others to use
  * Profile the run time of your code and identify the computational bottlenecks
  * Set up and release Python packages publicly
