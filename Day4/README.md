# Day 4

## Project Goals

  * Add tests to your repo and try to debug your code so the tests pass
  * Have an example/demo of your package (preferably in your docs or in your repo)
  * Another group should be able to install and run your package tomorrow!

## Learning Objectives

  * Decide and implement parallelized Python code for “embarrassingly parallel” problems
  * Write tests for your code
  * Avoid discrminatory behavior when coding
